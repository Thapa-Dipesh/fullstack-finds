HEADER CONFIGURATION

This section fixes the "MIME type ('application/octet-stream') is not a supported" error

by explicitly forcing Netlify to use the correct Content-Type header for JavaScript files.

==============================================================================

[[headers]]

Target JavaScript files in the common 'assets' subdirectory (e.g., /assets/index-xxxxxxxx.js)

for = "/assets/*.js"
[headers.values]
Content-Type = "application/javascript"

[[headers]]

Target JavaScript files located in the build's root directory (e.g., /main.js)

for = "/*.js"
[headers.values]
Content-Type = "application/javascript"

[[headers]]

Target CSS files in case they also have a MIME type issue

for = "/assets/*.css"
[headers.values]
Content-Type = "text/css"
